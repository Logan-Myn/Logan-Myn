### Salut, i'm logan

French guy who somehow ended up in estonia. still not sure how that happened, but the wifi is great and I like the snow.

I spend my days building web apps and my evenings on the dance floor. Sometimes I confuse the two and end up debugging at 2am with bachata music playing.

I mostly work with **typescript** and **next.js** because i like pain that's well-documented.

If you're here fromt the hackathon — Hi, I promise the code is better than this bio.
