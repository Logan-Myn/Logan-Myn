### salut, i'm logan

french guy who somehow ended up in estonia. still not sure how that happened, but the wifi is great and the winters build character.

i spend my days building web apps and my evenings on the dance floor. sometimes i confuse the two and end up debugging at 2am with salsa music playing.

i mostly work with **typescript** and **next.js** because i like pain that's well-documented.

if you're here from a hackathon — hi, i promise the code is better than this bio.
